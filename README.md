# Lo-Fi presentation deck
A basic presentation deck template for the browser which produces nice print output with a slide per page.

Put together after presenting an [ignite talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignite_(event)), deciding I was over the complexities and annoyances of Powerpoint (and related) and that authoring in just HTML allows for a more precise layout.

## Features
- Just static HTML/CSS.
- Automatic page numbering in the footer via a little JavaScript.
- Each slide a single print page (via CSS `page-break-after`) - just print to PDF and present with your favorite viewer.
- Intentionally provides a limited set of styles:
	- Single heading
	- Paragraph
	- Lists
	- Code blocks/inline
	- Tables (but not _really_ ideal for this format)
	- Images (responsive, single per slide)

... and not a single star wipe in sight:
